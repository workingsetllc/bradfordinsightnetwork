            <h2>For AI Teams</h2>
            
            <div class="about-content">
                <p>When human judgment matters, access isn't enough.</p>
                
                <p>AI teams are increasingly good at collecting data. What's harder — and often more important — is capturing expert judgment in a way that reflects how experts actually think, evaluate, and disagree.</p>
                
                <p>We work with AI teams that need credible, high-signal human insight to support model development, validation, and decision-making — especially in domains where ground truth is ambiguous and experience matters.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Direct Access to Senior MLB-Level Experts</strong></p>
                
                <p>Bradford Insight Network provides AI teams with direct access to senior MLB-level evaluators, coaches, and practitioners — experts whose judgment is shaped by decades of real-world decision-making and who are rarely available through traditional expert networks.</p>
                
                <p>These are not crowd-sourced respondents or lightly vetted consultants. They are domain authorities who participate because of trust and reputation, and who engage thoughtfully when the work is serious.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Designed for Real Evaluation, Not Just Labels</strong></p>
                
                <p>Many AI workflows treat human input as something to be normalized quickly — labels to be collected, averaged, or discarded once a model converges.</p>
                
                <p>That approach breaks down when:</p>
                
                <p>• Expert disagreement is meaningful<br>
                • Confidence and uncertainty matter<br>
                • Intent and context influence interpretation<br>
                • Edge cases are more valuable than consensus</p>
                
                <p>Our engagements are structured to surface judgment, not flatten it. Experts contribute independently and in their own voice, allowing AI teams to see not just what an expert thinks, but how they reason.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Flexible Integration with Your Existing Workflow</strong></p>
                
                <p>We work comfortably with teams that already have strong internal processes for collecting and using expert input.</p>
                
                <p>When those processes exist, we integrate directly — delivering expert insight in formats that align with your tooling, data pipelines, and evaluation frameworks.</p>
                
                <p>When they don't, or when existing approaches struggle to capture nuance, we can design fit-for-purpose capture mechanisms that support your objectives without imposing a generic platform or rigid methodology.</p>
                
                <p>The goal is always the same: expert signal that holds up downstream.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Engagements Led End to End</strong></p>
                
                <p>AI teams shouldn't have to manage expert sourcing, coordination, and delivery on top of already complex technical work.</p>
                
                <p>Client engagements are led end to end by the firm's principals, ensuring:</p>
                
                <p>• The right experts are engaged for the specific question<br>
                • Interactions are structured thoughtfully<br>
                • Timelines are respected<br>
                • Insight arrives usable, contextualized, and reliable</p>
                
                <p>This allows AI teams to stay focused on modeling, experimentation, and deployment — not logistics.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Where This Work Is Most Valuable</strong></p>
                
                <p>We're most effective when AI teams are working on problems where:</p>
                
                <p>• Judgment cannot be reduced to simple labels<br>
                • Training data is sparse, noisy, or contested<br>
                • Evaluation requires interpretation, not just accuracy<br>
                • Expert disagreement is itself a signal<br>
                • Model behavior needs to be understood, not just optimized</p>
                
                <p>If you're building systems that operate in the real world — not just benchmarks — this work tends to matter.</p>
                
                <p><strong>A Different Kind of Partner</strong></p>
                
                <p>We are not a platform vendor.<br>
                We are not a volume expert network.<br>
                We are not a generic consulting firm.</p>
                
                <p>Bradford Insight Network is a principal-led, relationship-driven partner for AI teams that care about the quality and integrity of human input — and about using that input responsibly.</p>
                
                <p>If that describes your work, we should talk.</p>
